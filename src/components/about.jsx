    <p> I'm a freelance frontend (going on fullstack) who love what I do. I'm also a huge fantasy / sci-fi fan so if you ever want to talk Star Wars or Shonen Anime - or any other awesome outworldly topic - hit me up. I'm always looking to sharpen my skills so if you have an opensource project in mind, give me a shout as well.</p>
